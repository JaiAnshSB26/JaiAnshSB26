## Hello, नमस्ते, ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ, Salut, Hola, привет 👋  Jai here.
*"The ones who go the farthest are the ones who never stop building."*

*"What you can’t measure, you can’t improve. What you can imagine, you can build."*

*“Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist.” - Picasso*

*“Greatness is engineered, not inherited.”*

*"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."*


## 🚀 About Me

I am an **entrepreneurial-minded problem-solver, systems-oriented engineer** and a **technology-finance** enthusiast, currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at École Polytechnique (France)**.

My interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Quantitative Finance, and high-performance software systems**. I am particularly drawn to problems that sit at the boundary of **theory and deployment**, where mathematical modeling, algorithmic design, and real-world engineering constraints coexist. I am also almost equally buzzed about the intricacies of LLMs, Generative AI, Computer Vision, Financial Engineering and Hardware-Software Optimization. 

I enjoy building **end-to-end systems** - from research prototypes and optimization pipelines to production-grade APIs, open-source libraries, and deployed platforms. I care deeply about **correctness, scalability, interpretability, and measurable performance**, and I prefer work that stands up to scrutiny rather than superficial demos.

Long-term, my goal is to bridge **AI/ML, Mathematics, and Finance** through a combination of **research-driven exploration and product-focused execution**, translating abstract ideas into systems that operate under realistic constraints.
