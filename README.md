## Hello, ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á, ‡®∏‡®§‡®ø ‡®∏‡©ç‡®∞‡©Ä ‡®Ö‡®ï‡®æ‡®≤, Salut, Hola, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç üëã! Jai here!

## üöÄ **About Me** 
I am an **entrepreneurial-minded problem-solver and a technology-finance enthusiast**, currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science** in **Mathematics and Computer Science** at **√âcole Polytechnique**. My interests lie at the intersection of **AI/Machine Learning, Quantitative Finance & Trading, Software Development, and High-Performance Computing.**

I am particularly excited about **Machine learning, LLMs, Generative AI, Computer Vision, Mathematical Modeling, Algorithms, Financial Engineering, Hardware-Software optimization** -- anything that involves tackling **complex, high-stakes problems** with **precision and creativity**.

Whether it‚Äôs **optimizing trading strategies, building AI/Ml pipelines, or developing efficient, scalable models to solve real-world problems**, I thrive on trying to **apply structured, data-driven approaches to solve challenging real-world problems**. My long-term goal is to **bridge AI, Finance, Mathematics, and impact-driven innovation** to create solutions that push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.  

Currently, I am exploring:  
- **Quantitative Research & Trading** ‚Äì Algorithmic trading, statistical modeling, and backtesting strategies.  
- **AI-Powered Systems** ‚Äì Deep learning applications, NLP, and reinforcement learning.  
- **Mathematical Optimization** ‚Äì Convex optimization, stochastic calculus, and probabilistic modeling.  
- **High-Performance Computing** ‚Äì Low-latency systems, parallel computing, and GPU acceleration.

My goal is to **continuously push boundaries, learn from the best, create meaningful solutions through technology, and of course, strengthen my expertise in the fields I'm passionate about.**.
